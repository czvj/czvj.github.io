# How to Connect an SPI Display to Raspberry Pi 5B for GUI Display: A Step-by-Step Guide

The Raspberry Pi 5B introduces significant changes to its display architecture, rendering legacy tools like `fbcp` obsolete. This guide provides a comprehensive solution for configuring an SPI-based secondary display to support GUI output on the Raspberry Pi 5B, leveraging modern drivers and device tree overlays.

## Why `fbcp` No Longer Works on Raspberry Pi 5B

The `fbcp` utility relied on the **legacy display stack** (DispmanX), which was deprecated in Raspberry Pi OS Bullseye (2021). The Raspberry Pi 5B completely removes this legacy infrastructure, requiring users to adopt **TinyDRM drivers** and **panel-mipi-dbi** for SPI displays. This transition ensures better compatibility with modern Linux kernel standards but demands reconfiguration for existing projects.

**Core Keywords**: `fbcp`, Raspberry Pi 5B, legacy display stack, TinyDRM drivers

## Setting Up an SPI Display with TinyDRM Drivers

### Step 1: Update Your Operating System  
Ensure youâ€™re running the **latest Raspberry Pi OS** (64-bit recommended). Use the following commands to update your system:  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
sudo reboot
```

### Step 2: Configure `config.txt` for SPI Display  
Edit `/boot/config.txt` to enable the appropriate device tree overlay. For example, for an **ST7789-based display**:  
```bash
dtoverlay=mipi-dbi-spi,speed=32000000
dtparam=compatible=wavesku19650\0panel-mipi-dbi-spi
dtparam=write-only,cpha,cpol
dtparam=width=240,height=240,width-mm=23,height-mm=23
dtparam=reset-gpio=27,dc-gpio=25,backlight-gpio=18
```

**Pin Configuration**:  
- **DIN** â†’ GPIO10  
- **CLK** â†’ GPIO11  
- **CS** â†’ GPIO8  
- **RST** â†’ GPIO27  
- **DC** â†’ GPIO25  
- **BL** â†’ GPIO18

### Step 3: Add Firmware Files for Specific Panels  
Download and copy the firmware file (e.g., `wavesku19650.bin`) to `/lib/firmware/` for ST7789 or ILI9341 displays. This file defines display-specific initialization commands.  

Example firmware snippet for ST7789 rotation:  
```bash
command 0x36 0x60 # Rotate display 90 degrees
command 0x3a 0x05 # Set 16-bit color depth
```

## Rotating the Display Without Firmware Modifications  

Avoid modifying firmware files for rotation, as this can cause rendering artifacts. Instead, use the **Screen Configuration Editor** in Raspberry Pi OS:  
1. Open **Preferences > Screen Configuration**.  
2. Select your SPI display and apply rotation settings graphically.  

This method ensures compatibility with the displayâ€™s native orientation defined in the firmware.

## Playing Videos on an SPI Display  

Legacy tools like `mplayer` or `cvlc` may fail due to lack of KMS/DRM support. Instead, use **Wayfire** (a lightweight Wayland compositor) for smooth video playback:  

1. Install Wayfire:  
```bash
sudo apt install wayfire
```

2. Configure Wayfire to target the SPI display.  

For command-line video playback:  
```bash
wf-recorder --output=name_of_your_display --codec=vp9 --file=output.webm
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues  

### Issue: "Failed to open vchiq instance"  
- **Cause**: `fbcp` is incompatible with Raspberry Pi 5B.  
- **Solution**: Transition to TinyDRM drivers as outlined above.  

### Issue: Display Lights Up but Shows No Output  
- **Check**: Ensure firmware files are correctly placed in `/lib/firmware/`.  
- **Verify**: Use `dmesg | grep -i drm` to confirm driver loading.  

### Issue: Videos Play on SSH Session but Not on SPI Display  
- **Cause**: Default output is routed to HDMI.  
- **Fix**: Use environment variables to specify the DRM device:  
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0.0
vlc --vout=drm --fullscreen video.mp4
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  

### 1. Why was `fbcp` removed in Raspberry Pi 5B?  
The legacy display stack (DispmanX) was deprecated to align with modern Linux kernel standards. TinyDRM drivers now provide native DRM support for SPI displays.  

### 2. Can I use ILI9341 displays with Raspberry Pi 5B?  
Yes, but youâ€™ll need to compile firmware files and configure `mipi-dbi-spi` overlays. Community-provided firmware (e.g., `ili9341_firmware.bin`) simplifies this process.  

### 3. How do I optimize video playback on SPI displays?  
Use Wayfire or DRM-compatible players like `mpv` with hardware acceleration:  
```bash
mpv --gpu-context=drm --drm-device=/dev/dri/card0 video.mp4
```  

### 4. Is 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS required for SPI displays?  
While 32-bit may work, 64-bit is recommended for better compatibility with modern drivers and features.

## Conclusion  

Configuring an SPI display on the Raspberry Pi 5B requires a shift from legacy tools to modern DRM-based drivers. By updating your OS, configuring device tree overlays, and leveraging firmware files, you can achieve seamless GUI and video playback. For advanced users, community resources and Raspberry Pi engineers continue to refine TinyDRM support for new display panels.
