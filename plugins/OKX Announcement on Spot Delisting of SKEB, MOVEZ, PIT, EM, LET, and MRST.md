## OKX's Commitment to Transparency  

This delisting underscores OKX's dedication to fostering trust through:  

- **Clear Communication**: Providing ample notice and actionable steps.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Refining listing criteria based on market dynamics.

## Market Context: Why Delistings Matter  

Delistings often signal a token's declining relevance or compliance risks. For instance:  

| Token   | 30-Day Trading Volume | Regulatory Status       |  
|---------|-----------------------|-------------------------|  
| SKEB    | $12.5M                | Uncertain (Asia-focused)|  
| MRST    | $8.2M                 | Pending EU MiCA Review  |  

Tokens with low volume or regulatory ambiguity face heightened delisting risks.  

## Final Reminder

- **Deposit Suspension**: Closed since May 20.  
- **Trading Ends**: May 27 at 4:00 PM UTC+8.
