# What Is Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR)?

Hedera Hashgraph represents a significant evolution in distributed ledger technology (DLT), offering capabilities that surpass traditional blockchain systems. This guide explores its unique features, the role of HBAR tokens, and how Hedera's governance model supports enterprise-grade applications.

## Understanding Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera Hashgraph operates as a decentralized public network, enabling developers to create applications that are fast, fair, and secure. Unlike conventional blockchains, Hedera's architecture leverages a consensus algorithm called Hashgraph, which addresses critical limitations such as scalability and security. The platform was co-founded by Dr. Leemon Baird and Mande Harmon, drawing from their expertise in cybersecurity and distributed systems.

### Key Advantages Over Blockchain

1. **Scalability**: Traditional blockchains struggle to handle the transaction volumes required for mainstream adoption. Hedera's network processes up to 10,000 transactions per second, making it suitable for high-scale applications.
2. **Security**: Hedera's consensus mechanism is Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (ABFT), providing robust protection against Sybil and DDoS attacks.
3. **Governance**: Unlike many decentralized systems, Hedera features a structured governance model managed by the Hedera Governing Council, ensuring accountability and long-term stability.

## How Hedera Hashgraph Works

Hedera's Hashgraph consensus algorithm achieves consensus through a gossip protocol, where nodes share information efficiently. This method eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining, reducing environmental impact while maintaining security.

### Transaction Finality

Hedera transactions achieve finality in 3-5 seconds, drastically outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. This speed, combined with fees as low as $0.0001 per transaction, makes Hedera ideal for micropayments and high-frequency transactions.

## HBAR: The Native Cryptocurrency

HBAR serves as the backbone of the Hedera ecosystem, fulfilling two primary roles:

### Network Fuel

Developers use HBAR to pay for network services like smart contract execution and file storage. Applications can integrate HBAR for peer-to-peer payments, enabling innovative business models.

### Network Protection

HBAR tokens secure the network through a proof-of-stake mechanism. Nodes stake HBAR to participate in consensus, making attacks economically unviable.

#### Key Benefits of HBAR

- **High Throughput**: Processes 10,000+ transactions per second.
- **Low Costs**: Transaction fees remain consistently low.
- **Instant Finality**: Near-instant transaction confirmation enhances user experience.

### HBAR Economics

The initial token distribution began in September 2019, with 379 million tokens allocated to early investors. A strategic release schedule ensures 50 billion tokens will circulate over 15 years, promoting decentralization and network stability.

## Hedera Governing Council

The Hedera Governing Council comprises 39 global organizations, including IBM and Boeing, ensuring balanced decision-making across industries. This structure prevents power centralization and maintains long-term network integrity.

### Council Responsibilities

- Managing the network's codebase
- Preventing forks through a no-fork warranty
- Establishing initial network nodes
- Implementing term limits for equitable governance

Swirlds, the creator of the Hashgraph algorithm, holds a permanent seat, ensuring technical continuity.

## Third-Generation Public Ledger

Hedera represents the third generation of decentralized technology, combining the security of Bitcoin's proof-of-work with Ethereum's programmability while eliminating their limitations. Its energy-efficient consensus mechanism enables rapid transaction speeds and near-zero fees, positioning it as a scalable solution for mainstream adoption.

## Decentralized Applications (DApps) on Hedera

Hedera hosts over 500 DApps, ranging from startups to enterprises. Notable projects include Certara (healthcare analytics) and Carbon (digital rewards platform). This ecosystem demonstrates Hedera's versatility in supporting real-world applications.
