## Understanding Cryptocurrency Wallet Types

Before diving into specific products, it's crucial to understand the fundamental differences between wallet categories:

### Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets

| Feature                  | Hot Wallets                         | Cold Wallets                        |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Internet Connection** | Always online                       | Offline storage                     |
| **Security Level**      | Moderate (vulnerable to cyberattacks)| High (air-gapped protection)        |
| **Convenience**         | Instant transactions                | Requires physical access            |
| **Best For**            | Frequent trading                    | Long-term storage                   |

Hot wallets (software wallets, exchange accounts) are ideal for daily transactions but expose private keys to potential threats. **Cold storage wallets**â€”including hardware wallets and paper walletsâ€”keep private keys completely offline, making them impervious to remote attacks.
