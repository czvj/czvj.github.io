# Theta Network and THETA Token: A Comprehensive Guide  

The Theta Network is a decentralized blockchain protocol designed to revolutionize video content streaming by leveraging a peer-to-peer network of shared bandwidth. This guide explores its architecture, tokenomics, security features, and practical applications, while addressing common questions about its implementation and future potential.  

## Understanding Theta Network's Core Components  

Theta Network operates on a dual-token model (THETA and TFUEL) and employs a multi-tiered node system to ensure scalability and decentralization. Here's a breakdown of its foundational elements:  

### Dual-Token Economy  
1. **THETA Tokens**:  
   - Governance tokens with a capped supply of 1 billion.  
   - Used for staking by validators and participating in network governance.  
2. **TFUEL Tokens**:  
   - Utility tokens for transaction fees, smart contract execution, and rewarding edge nodes.  

### Node Structure  
- **Enterprise Validator Nodes**: Run by reputable entities like Google and Binance.  
- **Guardian Nodes**: Community-operated nodes ensuring transaction accuracy.  
- **Edge Nodes**: Individual users sharing bandwidth to earn TFUEL.  

### Consensus Mechanism  
Theta employs a **Modified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** system, enabling high throughput and security. The integration of Guardian Nodes in Mainnet 2.0 and smart contract capabilities in Mainnet 3.0 further enhances its scalability.  

## Market Performance and Token Metrics  

The following metrics highlight the THETA token's current status:  

| Metric          | Value       |  
|-----------------|-------------|  
| Price (USD)     | $[X]        |  
| 24h Change      | [X]%        |  
| Market Cap Rank | #[X]        |  
| All-Time High   | $[X]        |  
| All-Time Low    | $[X]        |
