# Ripple (XRP) Price: Can Rippleâ€™s IPO Rumors Fuel XRPâ€™s Next Major Rally?

## Price Action and Technical Analysis

XRP has recently demonstrated significant price movement, maintaining its position above the critical $2 psychological level. Currently trading at $2.32, the cryptocurrency has captured trader attention with a 5.83% gain over the past 24 hours and a substantial trading volume of $5.70 billion. Key technical levels to watch include:

- **Support Levels**: $2.20 (bullish trend line), $2.180, and $2.120
- **Resistance Zones**: $2.280, $2.30, $2.350, and potential targets at $2.40â€“$2.45

Technical indicators reveal mixed signals. While the hourly MACD is losing momentum in the bullish zone, the RSI remains above 50, suggesting continued buying pressure. A breakthrough above $2.320 could trigger a cascade of institutional buying, particularly if IPO speculation intensifies.

## IPO Speculation Reshapes Market Sentiment

Crypto influencer Ansem reignited IPO discussions through a viral social media post that questioned the implications of a Ripple IPO for XRP holders. This speculation comes at a strategic time, as XRP maintains strength while broader market attention remains fragmented.

### Ripple's Financial Position

Ripple's escrow holdings of 36.2 billion XRP tokensâ€”worth approximately $79 billion at current pricesâ€”create unique market dynamics. This contrasts sharply with the company's last private valuation of $11.3 billion, suggesting potential undervaluation if traditional financial metrics were applied.

Market participants are drawing parallels with Circle's public listing, where shares surged 600% post-IPO. While Ripple has officially stated no 2025 IPO plans, cryptocurrency markets often prioritize speculation over immediate fundamentals.

## Market Dynamics and XRP's Position

The relationship between Ripple and XRP remains complex. Although legally separate entities, market behavior consistently treats them as interconnected. This correlation manifests in:

1. Price reactions to Ripple's banking partnerships
2. Legal developments involving the SEC lawsuit
3. Strategic announcements about XRP usage in cross-border payments

The 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level near current support zones adds technical significance to XRP's consolidation pattern. Traders are monitoring whether the $2.20 level will hold as a springboard for renewed upside momentum.
