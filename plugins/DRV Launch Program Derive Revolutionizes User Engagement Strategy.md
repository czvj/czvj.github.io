# DRV Launch Program: Derive Revolutionizes User Engagement Strategy  

The DRV Launch Program marks a pivotal shift in Derive's approach to incentivizing user participation in its decentralized derivatives trading ecosystem. This initiative replaces the original DRV token airdrop with a dynamic rewards system that rewards multiple user activities, creating unprecedented opportunities for crypto enthusiasts to earn while they trade, deposit, and refer new users.  

## Understanding the DRV Launch Program Mechanics  

At its core, the DRV Launch Program operates on a points-based system where user activities translate into claimable DRV tokens. For every $1 of trading fees paid (approximately Rp16,253), users earn 100 activity points convertible to DRV. This structure creates direct value alignment between platform usage and token distribution.  

Key participation avenues include:  
- **Trading Activity**: Standard trading fees generate base points  
- **Strategic Participation**: Low-fee trades or liquidity provision to new markets earn **5x bonus points**  
- **Vault Deposits**: Asset deposits into Derive's vaults earn additional points proportional to deposited amounts  
- **Referral Program**: Users receive **10% of their referred friends' paid fees**

## Tokenomics and Staking Benefits  

DRV tokens will officially launch on January 15, 2025, with staking options available immediately. Participants can choose between:  
1. **Standard Staking**: 28-day lock-up period with full rewards  
2. **Instant Access**: Immediate liquidity with 20% penalty on earned stDRV  

The initial distribution allocates **1,000,000 DRV tokens** weekly for rewards. This creates predictable earning opportunities while maintaining token scarcity.  

### Staking Comparison Table  

| Option        | Lock-up Period | Penalty | Rewards Access |

| Instant       | None           | 20%     | Immediate      |
