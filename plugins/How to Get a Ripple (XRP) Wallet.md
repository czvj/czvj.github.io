## Understanding XRP Wallets  

### What Is an XRP Wallet?  

An XRP wallet is a digital tool designed to store, send, and receive Ripple tokens. Unlike traditional bank accounts, these wallets use cryptographic keys to secure your assets. Two critical components define their functionality:  

- **Public Key**: Acts as your wallet address, which you can share to receive XRP.  
- **Private Key**: A unique code granting access to your funds. **Never share this**, as losing it means permanent loss of your tokens.  

Rippleâ€™s blockchain focuses on streamlining global financial transactions. Banks and payment providers leverage its network for fast, low-cost cross-border transfers.

### Ripple Wallet Address Explained  

A Ripple wallet address typically starts with the letter "r" (e.g., **r34v7y6d54q37654321**) and consists of a random combination of letters and numbers. This address allows seamless transfer and receipt of XRP.  

#### Destination Tags vs. Smart Contracts  
Unlike Ethereumâ€™s smart contracts, Ripple uses **destination tags** to route transactions. These numeric codes ensure funds reach the correct recipient, especially for exchanges or organizations using a single wallet address for multiple users.
