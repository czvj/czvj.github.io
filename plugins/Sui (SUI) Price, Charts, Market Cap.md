# Sui (SUI) Price, Charts, Market Cap  

## What is Sui (SUI)?  

Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain platform designed to deliver high throughput, low-latency transactions, and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). Developed by former Meta engineers, Sui leverages an **object-oriented model** to process transactions, distinguishing itself from traditional account-based blockchains. This architecture prioritizes horizontal scaling, enabling the network to handle increasing transaction volumes without compromising speed or efficiency.  

The platformâ€™s primary mission is to support next-generation applications in sectors like **NFTs**, **gaming**, **decentralized social media**, and **identity platforms**. By optimizing for parallel processing and reducing computational redundancy, Sui aims to address common blockchain limitations such as congestion and high gas fees.  

## Who Created Sui?  

Sui was founded by a team of five former Meta engineers:  
- **Evan Cheng** (Director of Engineering at Metaâ€™s Novi division)  
- **Adeniyi Abiodun**  
- **Sam Blackshear**  
- **George Danezis**  
- **Kostas Chalkias**  

These co-founders established **Mysten Labs**, the company behind Sui, after working on blockchain initiatives at Metaâ€™s Novi research lab. Their vision was to build a blockchain optimized for user-centric applications, combining academic research with practical engineering.  

### Funding and Partnerships  
Mysten Labs has secured significant investments from leading crypto venture capital firms, including:  
- **a16z** (raised $36 million in Series A in December 2021)  
- **Jump Crypto**  
- **Binance Labs**  
- **Coinbase Ventures**  
- **Franklin Templeton**  

The companyâ€™s Series B funding round in 2022 raised **$300 million**, valuing Mysten Labs at **$2 billion**. These partnerships underscore confidence in Suiâ€™s technical roadmap and market potential.  

## What Makes Sui Unique?  

Suiâ€™s innovation lies in its approach to transaction processing and data modeling. Unlike most blockchains that use account-based systems (e.g., Ethereum), Sui employs an **object-oriented model**, where data is structured around objects rather than accounts. This design enables:  

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:  
   Sui processes unrelated transactions in parallel across multiple nodes, unlike vertical scaling models that rely on single-node upgrades. This allows the network to achieve **high throughput** (theoretically up to 120,000 transactions per second).  

2. **Efficient Validation**:  
   Validators only process transactions relevant to their assigned data shards, reducing computational overhead.  

3. **Flexible Ownership Models**:  
   - **Single ownership** (e.g., NFTs or cryptocurrency)  
   - **Shared ownership** (e.g., AMM pools)  
   - **Delegated ownership** (e.g., tokenized assets)  

### Use Cases  
Suiâ€™s architecture makes it ideal for:  
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Fast, low-cost minting and trading.  
- **Web3 Gaming**: Real-time interactions with minimal latency.  
- **Decentralized Social Media**: Scalable content distribution and user engagement.  
- **Identity Verification**: Secure, privacy-preserving data management.  

## Suiâ€™s Tokenomics: SUI Token  

The **SUI token** serves as the native utility token for the Sui blockchain. Key functions include:  
- **Gas Fees**: Paying for transaction processing.  
- **Storage Fund**: Compensating validators for data storage costs.  
- **Governance**: Participating in protocol upgrades and decisions.  

### Supply and Distribution  
While Sui has not yet released detailed tokenomics, the following is anticipated:  
- **Total Supply**: Yet to be announced.  
- **Airdrop**: A portion of tokens will be distributed to early participants in incentivized testnets.  
- **Staking**: Validators will earn rewards for securing the network.  

The SUI token will be introduced upon the launch of the **Sui mainnet**, expected in 2025.  

### FAQ: When Will SUI Be Available for Purchase?  
SUI tokens will not be tradable until the mainnet launch. Once active, they will likely be listed on major exchanges like [OKX](https://bit.ly/okx-bonus).

## How Secure is the Sui Network?  

Suiâ€™s security framework is built on two core components:  
1. **Narwhal Consensus**: A high-throughput Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol.  
2. **Object Validation**: Ensuring only relevant validators process specific data.  

This dual-layer approach minimizes attack vectors while maintaining decentralization. Additionally, Suiâ€™s smart contract language, **Move**, enhances security by enforcing resource safety and preventing common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.  

### Validator Incentives  
Validators are rewarded with SUI tokens for maintaining network integrity. The storage fund model further aligns incentives by compensating validators for long-term data storage costs.  

### FAQ: How Does Sui Compare to Ethereum?  
Suiâ€™s object-oriented model and horizontal scaling offer faster transactions and lower fees compared to Ethereumâ€™s account-based, vertically scaled architecture.
