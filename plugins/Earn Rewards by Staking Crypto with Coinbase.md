- **Regulatory compliance**: Clear fee structures and adherence to security standards.
- **Diverse asset support**: Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and more.

## How Staking Works on Coinbase

Staking involves locking up eligible cryptocurrencies to support blockchain networks. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Hold Supported Assets**: Maintain a minimum balance of eligible PoS coins like Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL).
2. **Meet Eligibility Requirements**: Complete identity verification and ensure residency in supported regions.
3. **Earn Rewards**: Coinbase pools assets to validate transactions, distributing rewards after deducting a service fee.
4. **Flexible Payouts**: Rewards are credited to your account based on blockchain protocols, with estimated APYs displayed upfront.

### Reward Distribution and Fees
- **APY Variability**: Annual percentage yields fluctuate based on network conditions. For example, Ethereum staking may offer 4â€“6% APY, while Solana could range between 5â€“8%.
- **Fees**: Coinbase retains a portion of rewards for operational costs. The displayed APY reflects net returns after fees.

## Eligible Cryptocurrencies for Staking

Coinbase supports staking for multiple assets, including:
- **Ethereum (ETH)**: Post-Merge PoS network with liquid staking via cbETH.
- **Solana (SOL)**: High-throughput blockchain with sub-2-day reward accrual.
- **Cardano (ADA)**: Energy-efficient staking with ~3â€“5% APY.
- **Avalanche (AVAX)** and **Cosmos (ATOM)**: Fast-finality networks with competitive yields.

**Note**: Stablecoins like USDC generate yield through lending programs, not traditional staking.
