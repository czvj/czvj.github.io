## What Is Stellar (XLM)?

**Stellar (XLM)** is a decentralized blockchain platform designed to facilitate cross-border transactions between financial institutions, banks, and individuals. Its native cryptocurrency, **Lumen (XLM)**, serves as the network's utility token, enabling fast, low-cost transfers across multiple currencies. The platform combines:

- **Decentralized Exchange**: Integrated order books for crypto, fiat, and digital assets
- **Smart Contracts**: Support for multi-signature transactions and programmable financial operations
- **Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)**: A unique consensus mechanism ensuring security and scalability

### Key Features of Stellar

| Feature               | Benefit                                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Transaction Speed** | 3-5 second confirmation times                |
| **Cost Efficiency**   | $0.00001 per transaction fee                 |
| **Decentralization**  | No single point of failure                   |
| **Scalability**       | Thousands of transactions per second capacity|
| **Security**          | DoS attack prevention through XLM staking    |

## Stellar's Founders and Evolution

Jed McCaleb (co-founder of Ripple) and Joyce Kim launched Stellar in 2014. While initially built on Ripple's protocol, the project underwent a fundamental shift in 2015 when its consensus mechanism was reengineered to create the **Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP)**. This innovation addressed centralization concerns in Ripple's model, positioning Stellar as a more distributed alternative.

Key developments:
- **2015**: Token rebrand from "Stellar" to "Lumen (XLM)"
- **2019**: Community-driven decision to burn 5.5 billion XLM tokens, reducing maximum supply to 50 billion
- **Ongoing**: Stellar Development Foundation manages remaining reserves for ecosystem growth

## XLM Tokenomics Explained

Unlike proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, XLM cannot be mined. The total supply follows this structure:
- **Initial Distribution**: 100 billion tokens at launch
- **Annual Inflation**: 1% for first 5 years (discontinued in 2019)
- **Post-Burn Supply**:
  - **Public Circulation**: ~20 billion XLM
  - **Foundation Reserves**: ~30 billion XLM

The network requires a minimum account balance of 1 XLM to prevent spam, while transaction fees of $0.00001 deter DoS attacks without impacting usability.
