# The Token Standards Of Qtum: QRC20 and QRC721 Explained  

Qtumâ€™s unique blockchain architecture combines Bitcoinâ€™s UTXO model with Ethereumâ€™s EVM capabilities, enabling developers to create robust decentralized applications (dApps) and tokens. This article explores two foundational token standards on Qtumâ€”**QRC20** and **QRC721**â€”and their parallels to Ethereumâ€™s **ERC20** and **ERC721** standards. By understanding these frameworks, developers can build interoperable tokens that power Qtumâ€™s ecosystem.  

## Why Token Standards Matter  

Token standards are essential for blockchain interoperability. Without universal protocols, dApps would operate in silos, unable to communicate or exchange assets. Ethereumâ€™s adoption of **ERC20** and **ERC721** streamlined token creation and interaction, inspiring Qtum to adopt similar standardsâ€”**QRC20** for fungible tokens and **QRC721** for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These standards ensure consistency across wallets, exchanges, and dApps.  

### Key Concepts  
- **Fungibility**: Assets that are interchangeable (e.g., fiat currency).  
- **Non-Fungibility**: Unique assets with distinct properties (e.g., digital art).  
- **Interoperability**: Seamless integration between blockchain networks and applications.

## QRC20: Fungible Tokens on Qtum  

**QRC20** mirrors Ethereumâ€™s **ERC20** standard, defining functions for creating and managing fungible tokens. These tokens are divisible, replicable, and ideal for currencies, stablecoins, or utility tokens.  

### Core Functions of QRC20  
| Function        | Purpose                          |  
|-----------------|----------------------------------|  
| `totalSupply`   | Returns total token supply       |  
| `balanceOf`     | Checks user token balance        |  
| `transfer`      | Sends tokens to another address  |  
| `approve`       | Authorizes third-party transfers |  

### Deploying QRC20 Tokens  
1. **Install Dependencies**: Use Qtumâ€™s **Solar** tool and Solidity compiler.  
2. **Generate Deposit Address**: Use `qtum-cli getnewaddress`.  
3. **Interact with Contracts**:  
   - **Check Balance**:  
     ```bash  
     qtum-cli callcontract {CONTRACT_ADDRESS} 70a08231{userAddressHex}  
     ```  
   - **Withdraw Tokens**:  
     ```bash  
     qtum-cli sendtocontract {CONTRACT_ADDRESS} a9059cbb{userAddressHex}{amountHex}  
     ```

## QRC721: Non-Fungible Tokens on Qtum  

**QRC721** aligns with Ethereumâ€™s **ERC721** standard, enabling the creation of unique, indivisible tokens like NFTs. These tokens represent ownership of digital or physical assets, with metadata ensuring uniqueness.  

### Core Functions of QRC721  
| Function                | Purpose                          |  
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| `ownerOf(tokenId)`      | Returns the owner of a token     |  
| `approve(to, tokenId)`  | Grants transfer rights           |  
| `transfer(from, to)`    | Moves ownership between addresses|  

### Deploying QRC721 Tokens  
1. **Set Up Environment**:  
   - Clone the QRC721 repository:  
     ```bash  
     git clone https://github.com/qtumproject/QRC721Token.git  
     ```  
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`.  
2. **Deploy with Solar**:  
   ```bash  
   solar deploy contracts/QRC721.sol '["name","symbol"]' --qtum_rpc=http://rpcuser:rpcpassword@localhost:port  
   ```  
3. **Verify Deployment**:  
   Check the `solar.development.json` file for contract details like address and transaction ID.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  

### 1. Whatâ€™s the Difference Between QRC20 and QRC721?  
QRC20 tokens are **fungible** (interchangeable), while QRC721 tokens are **non-fungible** (unique). For example, QRC20 could represent USD coins, while QRC721 might represent a rare digital collectible.  

### 2. How Do I Check Token Balances?  
Use the `balanceOf` function with the `qtum-cli` command:  
```bash  
qtum-cli callcontract {CONTRACT_ADDRESS} 70a08231{userAddressHex}  
```  

### 3. Can I Transfer Ownership of an NFT?  
Yes, via the `transfer` function. The owner can send their NFT to another address, or use `approve` to authorize a third party.  

### 4. Are QRC Tokens Compatible with Ethereum?  
While QRC standards are inspired by Ethereumâ€™s ERC20 and ERC721, they are tailored for Qtumâ€™s UTXO+EVM architecture. Cross-chain interoperability requires bridges or sidechains.

## Expanding Qtumâ€™s Token Ecosystem  

Qtumâ€™s hybrid model allows developers to leverage Ethereumâ€™s EVM while benefiting from Bitcoinâ€™s security. By adopting **QRC20** and **QRC721**, projects can create tokens that are:  
- **Scalable**: UTXO model enables faster transactions.  
- **Secure**: Bitcoinâ€™s PoW consensus protects against attacks.  
- **Interoperable**: Standards ensure compatibility with wallets and dApps.
