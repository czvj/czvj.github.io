## Case Study: Successful Copy Trading in 2024  

**Scenario**: A beginner investor allocates $1,000 to copy a trader specializing in altcoins.  
- **Strategy**: 30% allocation to Trader A (high-risk, high-reward) and 70% to Trader B (low-risk, steady returns).  
- **Outcome**: After six months, Trader Aâ€™s portfolio gains 40% (30% of $1,000 = $120 profit), while Trader B gains 15% (70% of $1,000 = $105 profit). Total profit: **$225**.
